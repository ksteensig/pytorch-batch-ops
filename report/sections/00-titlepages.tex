}{% the abstract
  The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has many uses in scientific computing. A recent use is to measure the complexity of functions a Deep Neural Network (DNN) can represent. For this measure only the 10\% largest singular values are necessary.

By restricting to feed-forward DNNs using ReLU activation functions, it results in sparse weights which makes the implemented solution possible.

The solution is to use the Compressed Singular Value Decomposition (cSVD) which uses the sparsity property to only sample the requires 10\% largest singular values rather than all of them.

The result is approximately 12 times the performance over a full rank SVD and a mean squared error of less than $1.5 \cdot 10^{-4}$ for a specific example.
